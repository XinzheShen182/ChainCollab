# Research on Trusted Multi-Party Collaborative Processes Based on Blockchain Technology and BPMN

Our research focuses on developing a trusted multi-party collaborative process framework leveraging blockchain technology and BPMN. Since our work was developed incrementally, we chose to organize it into different branches within a single repository rather than using multiple repositories.

This branch serves as an **overview page** for introducing our research results and projects. Below are our key works:

## [IBC](https://github.com/XinzheShen182/IBC/tree/IBC)

**Overview**:  
IBC is an integrated framework combining blockchain with BPMN choreography. It provides features such as Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) for Fabric, Smart Contract generation based on BPMN choreography, and interactive modeling tools.

**Paper**: IBC: An Integrated framework combining blockchain with BPMN choreography to enhance multi-party collaboration[https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00067](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00067)

**Status**: Completed.

## [BlockCollab](https://github.com/XinzheShen182/IBC/tree/BlockCollab)

**Overview**:  
Built on IBC, BlockCollab offers more granular identity management in the BaaS layer. It also supports advanced BPMN choreography and DMN modeling, referred to as the extended-BPMN model.

**Paper**: A Hybrid BPMN-DMN Framework for Secure Inter-organizational Processes and Decisions Collaboration on Permissioned Blockchain. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01196](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01196)

**Status**: Completed.
